### Project Title
Explore Sakila DVD rental using SQL Queries

### Description
This project is a part of an Udacity's nanodegree offering named "Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Program".

The following queries are answered using SQL:
1. We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it's classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

2. Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for.
Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels
(first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on
the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?
Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.

3. Provide a table with family-friendly film category, each of quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
Category, Rental length category, Count
